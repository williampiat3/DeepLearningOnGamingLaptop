# Deep Learning On A Gaming Laptop
This folder presents the installation that we made on a Lenovo Legion Y920 with i7 and a GPU NVIDIA GeForce 1070 in my former company, for a better agility we managed for our work in Applied Deep learning. This would give the possibility to anyone to build their own installation so that they can practice freely.
Although this guide is well written and ends up in a perfectly working setup, you will need some linux skills in order to fix the issues that will be coming after this installation (if you update the cuda drivers or other things that might eventually arrive).

This installation was made on a specific model of computer and you might have issues transfering it to another, but it gives a lot of solution to a wide range of problems we encountered. I believe it is a rather complete guide.

## Installation version
By following this guide you'll install this environement:

On a Lenovo Legion Y920 - Core i7-7820HK - 16 Go - SSD 256 Go + HDD 1 To - Screen 17.3" LED Full HD - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 8 Go you'll have:

* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
* Cuda 10.0
* Cudnn
* Python 3.7
* Tensorflow-gpu > 2.0
* Pytorch 1.4  for cuda 10.0


Along with other libraries that are quite handy for manipulating data and visulizations

## Material requirements
You'll need:
* A bootable key with Ubuntu 18.04
* A paperclip (or any pointy thing you'll find)
* Patience (seriously)
* The freshly bought PC
